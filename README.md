IPL Analysis 2008-2022

As an avid data enthusiast, I've channeled my passion for cricket into developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that encapsulates the thrilling spirit of the IPL seasons from 2008 to 2022. This interactive dashboard not only offers a cumulative summary of the tournaments' rich history but also affords the flexibility to zoom in on a specific season's analytics at the user's behest.

The 2010 season, for instance, unfolds a narrative of the Chennai Super Kings' remarkable victory, while individual accolades like the Orange and Purple Caps celebrate the stellar performances of season maestros SR Tendulkar and PP Ojha. The dashboard springs to life with vibrant visualizations of 587 sixes and 1709 fours, painting a vivid picture of the season's exhilarating gameplay.

Diving into player specifics, we see Virat Kohli's impressive tally of 307 runs with a strike rate of 142.13, complemented by DJ Bravo's economical spell snaring 4 wickets. The team dynamics section sheds light on Mumbai Indians' strategic dominance with 11 wins and highlights the tactical advantage of fielding first, reflected in a 67.7% win rate for toss winners.

Moreover, the venue analysis underscores iconic stadiums like Eden Gardens, immortalizing matches won predominantly through sheer run accumulation. This dashboard is not just a collection of stats but a storytelling canvas that captures the pulse and dynamism of IPL cricket.
